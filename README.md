# VBA-challenge

In this homework, our instructions were to create a VBA script to utilize the established data in an Excel spreadsheet.

I created four new columns to showcase quarterly change, percent change, and the total stock volume from each stock by the quarterly data.

I then used those four columns to show which stocks had the greatest percentage increase/decrease and which stock had the greatest total stock volume.
